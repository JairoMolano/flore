    "description": "Flor√© was born from a conversation between friends, one of those that starts with a coffee and ends with a great idea: to create a place where brunch is not just a meal, but an experience. Inspired by the freshness of local ingredients and a love for gastronomy, we decided to open a space that mixed the best of breakfast and lunch, with that sweet and savory touch we love so much.\nIn the heart of Neiva, we opened the doors to this corner that many now call their favorite place to start the day with flavor, joy, and warmth."
